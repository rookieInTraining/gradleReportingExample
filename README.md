An easy way for generating reports in gradle. Can be used in projects where the reports are not more than 2 html pages. Works only for a single junit xml file

To generate the report :

```gradle clean resultGenerator```

An example of the result generated can be viewed [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/gradlereporterdemo/build/index.html).
